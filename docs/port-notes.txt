Currently, the port numbers are hard-wired inside the nginx.conf file.
Every service has its own port.
This is needed for docker.
But not for k8s.
It would be nice if k8s could just use a single port for all services.
This will simplify the k8s yaml files.
So I'd like to parameterize the ports.
How to do this so the same nginx image works for both k8s and docker???

The idea from stevencohn?
Create a script that does a sequence of sed env replacements.
Call the script in the Dockerfile (after adding it).
The sed replacement needs to be part of the CMD string
to allow parameterization of the image at start time.
Now commander can add env-var to its yaml file.
k8s yaml scripts add different env-var.
In fact they should only need the one env-var for the single port number.

There is already a mechanism in nginx :-)

It might be possible to switch ports on the live k8s site
without downtime by temporarily running each service on 2 ports.
Eg by literally starting two sinatra servers.
Should work for everything except saver which has a volume mount.
